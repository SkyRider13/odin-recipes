        <li>     ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
            
        <li>     1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
      
    </ul>
    
        <h4> Raita </h4>
    <ul>
        
        <li>1 (5.3 ounce) container plain Greek yogurt</li>

        <li>½ cup peeled, shredded cucumber, drained</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons shredded yellow onion</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        
        
    </ul>

    <h4> Wraps </h4>
    <ul>
        
        <li>     2 (8.8 ounce) packages naan breads (2 per package), warmed </li>

        <li>     2 cups shredded lettuce </li>
            
        <li>     4 thin slices red onion, separated into rings </li>
            
        <li>     1 medium tomato, thinly sliced </li>
    </ul>


    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>At least 2 hours ahead, or up to 8 hours ahead, combine olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder, paprika, cumin, coriander, pepper flakes, turmeric, salt, pepper, and cinnamon in a bowl. Stir ingredients well and add chicken pieces. Cover and refrigerate. Stir chicken pieces and marinade about every 2 hours.</li>

        <li>About 30 minutes prior to grilling, make the raita by mixing yogurt, cucumber, onion, cilantro, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to make the wraps.</li>
        
        <li>Preheat an outdoor gas grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        
        <li>Place chicken pieces in a single layer onto the oiled grate, and grill until no longer pink in the center, the juices run clear, and both sides are brown, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Timing will depend on the thickness of the chicken thighs and the distance of the grates to the heat. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        
        <li>Place grilled chicken on a cutting board and cover with aluminum foil. Allow chicken to rest 5 to 10 minutes, then cut into thin slices.</li>
        
        <li>To assemble the wraps, divide ingredients evenly: Place chicken slices in the center of each naan bread. Top with shredded lettuce, onion rings, and tomato slices; spoon raita on top.</li>
        
        <li>Wrap each naan around the sandwich ingredients, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
